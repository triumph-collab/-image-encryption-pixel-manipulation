# Caesar Cipher – Prodigy InfoTech Task 1

## 🔐 Description
This project implements a Caesar Cipher in Python. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters of the alphabet by a given value.

## 📚 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab

## 💻 How It Works
- Each alphabetic character in the message is shifted by the specified number (the "key").
- Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation) are not changed.
- Decryption simply shifts the letters in the reverse direction.

## ▶️ Usage

### 1. Open the Notebook
Run the Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab or locally via Jupyter.

### 2. Input your message and shift value
You will be prompted to enter:
- A message
- A shift value (e.g., 3)

### 3. See Results
The notebook will display:
- The encrypted message
- The decrypted version of the message

## ✅ Example
Enter your message: hello world, good morning, how are you doing
Enter shift value: 3
🔐 Encrypted: khoor zruog, jrrg pruqlqj, krz duh brx grlqj
🔓 Decrypted: hello world, good morning, how are you doing
